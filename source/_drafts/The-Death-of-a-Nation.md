I don't know where to start. I have no words to describe what is going around me. Last time I posted about hate. But looks like we are reaping what we sowed. That hate has come back to bite back each of us. If you still want to stick to the narrative that 'Hindu khatre me hai' after watching what is going on, you seriously need help.
